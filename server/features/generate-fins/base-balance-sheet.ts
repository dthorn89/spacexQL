// In this script, you define the balance sheet structure using the ASSETS array, 
// and for each variable portion (like Bank Accounts), you define a separate array (BANK_ACCOUNTS in this example).
// You then use nested loops to dynamically generate the content based on the structure and variables.

// For each section in the ASSETS array, the script checks if it's the section for Bank Accounts. 
// If so, it loops through the BANK_ACCOUNTS array to generate the bank account variations. 
// You can apply a similar approach for other sections and their associated variables.

// This approach allows you to maintain a clear outline of the balance sheet while dynamically generating the content with 
// variables based on the variations for each section.

// To accommodate variations within each section of the balance sheet outline, 
// you can use a combination of arrays to hold the structure and variables, 
// as well as loops to generate the content dynamically. Here's how you can achieve this:

# Create a temporary text file
TMPFILE=$(mktemp -t balance_sheet.XXXXXXXXXX)

# Define your balance sheet structure and variables
ASSETS=(
  "Current Assets"
  "- Cash and Cash Equivalents:"
  "  - Bank Accounts"
)
BANK_ACCOUNTS=(
  "Business Adv Fundamentals - 5151: \$VARIABLE1"
  "Business Advantage Sav - 5164: \$VARIABLE2"
  # ... Add more bank account variations here
)

# Loop through the balance sheet structure
for SECTION in "${ASSETS[@]}"; do
  echo "$SECTION" >> "$TMPFILE"

  # Check if the current section is for Bank Accounts
  if [[ "$SECTION" == *"- Bank Accounts" ]]; then
    # Loop through bank account variations
    for BANK_ACCOUNT in "${BANK_ACCOUNTS[@]}"; do
      echo "    - $BANK_ACCOUNT" >> "$TMPFILE"
    done
  fi

  # ... Add more variations for other sections here
done

# Convert the temporary text file to PDF using suitable tools (e.g., pandoc or wkhtmltopdf)
# Example with pandoc:
# pandoc -s $TMPFILE -o balance_sheet.pdf

# Clean up the temporary text file
rm $TMPFILE
